    This study will last for a randomly selected number of rounds.
    We are 99.9% confident the study will continue no longer than 30 rounds or two hours.
    At the beginning of the study you will be randomly assigned to the role of Person 1 or Person 2.
    You will maintain this role throughout the entire study.
    Each round, you will be paired with one other randomly selected participant, called your pairing.
    Each round, Person 1 will be given the choice between "R" and "S".
    If Person 1 chooses "S", Person 2 will be given the choice between "U" and "V".
    Based on the decisions of you and your pairing, you will receive the following payoffs from the tree below.
    Person 1's payoffs are on the top, and Person 2's payoffs are on the bottom.
    Payoff values are represented by points, and will be converted to dollars at the end of the study.

</p>
<p>
    Every round you will be presented with a screen containing the following:
    your role as Person 1 or Person 2 (which does not change), the current round, your choice history, your pairing's choice history, and the decision tree.
    Feel free to refer to the instructions when playing.
    At the end of each round you will be presented with a payoff screen, displaying your final payoff.
</p>
<p>
    This choice history is designed to tell you and your pairing what choices each other had made in previous periods.
    The choice history keeps track of how many R’s and S’s Person 1 has chosen, and how many U’s and V’s Person 2 has chosen.
    The following table is a hypothetical scenario.

        <tr>
            <th>1</th>
            <th>S</th>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>3</th>
            <th>R</th>

            <th>NA</th>
            <th>(1,1)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>4</th>
            <th>3</th>
            <th>(1,3)</th>
            <th>V</th>
            <th>(1,2)</th>
        </tr>
    </table>
</p>
<p>
    Initially, both Person 1 and Person 2 start with a choice history of (0,0).
    In round 1, Person 1 chooses S and Person 2 chooses V.
    At the end of round 1 Person 1’s score is (0,1), since Person 1 has chosen R zero times and chosen S one time.
    Person 2’s score is (0,1), since Person 2 has chosen U zero times and chosen V one time.
    At the end of period 4 we can see that Person 1 has chosen R one time and chosen S three times, while Person 2 has chosen U one time and chosen V two times.
    The choice history continues for all rounds in the study.
    This information can be used to inform your choices in the study.
</p>
<p>
    When the study ends, you will receive the total of all your payoffs, which is displayed on your screen.
    All choices are confidential and anonymous.
    No one will know who you are, who your pairings are, or what choices you made in the study, including the researchers.

    Upon conclusion of the study, feel free to exit the page. You will receive your earnings as a bonus to the recruitment HIT via Mechanical Turk.
    Any and all identifying information will be deleted. No one will be able to trace your behavior in the study back to you.

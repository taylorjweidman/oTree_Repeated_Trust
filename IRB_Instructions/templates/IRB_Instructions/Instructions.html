        This study will last for a randomly selected number of rounds. We are 99.9% confident the study will continue no longer than 
    30 rounds or two hours. At the beginning of the study you will be randomly assigned to the role of Person 1 or Person 2. You will 
    maintain this role throughout the entire study. Each round, you will be paired with one other randomly selected participant, 
    called your pairing. Each round, Person 1 will be given the choice between "R" and "S". If Person 1 chooses "S", Person 2 will 
    be given the choice between "U" and "V". Based on the decisions of you and your pairing, you will receive the following payoffs 
    from the tree below. Person 1's payoffs are on the top, and Person 2's payoffs are on the bottom. Payoff values are represented 
    by points, and will be converted to dollars at the end of the study.

        Every round you will be presented with a screen containing the following: your role as Person 1 or Person 2 (which does not 
    change), the current round, and the decision tree. Feel free to refer to the instructions when playing. At the end of each round 
    you will be presented with a payoff screen, displaying your final payoff.

        When the study ends, you will receive the total of all your payoffs, which will be displayed on your screen. All choices are 
    confidential and anonymous. No one will know who you are, who your pairings are, or what choices you made in the study, including 
    the researchers.

<p>
        Upon conclusion of the study, you will be presented with a unique Mechanical Turk code. Submit this code in Mechanical Turk to 
    receive compensation. No one will be able to trace your behavior in the study back to you.
